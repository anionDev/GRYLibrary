        Additional paths to search for .pdb (symbol) files. Symbols must be found for modules to be instrumented.
        If .pdb files are in the same folder as the .dll or .exe files, they are automatically found. Otherwise, specify them here.
        Note that searching for symbols increases code coverage run time. So keep this small and local.

        Each element in the list is a regular expression (ECMAScript syntax). See /visualstudio/ide/using-regular-expressions-in-visual-studio.

        Included items must then not match any entries in the exclude list to remain included.
