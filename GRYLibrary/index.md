# General

The GRYLibrary contains some useful functions and extensions written in C#. For example:
- Tablegenerator Generates ASCII-tables
- GRYLog Represents a (more or less) simple log-functionality
- SimpleGenericXMLSerializer To serialize/deserialize any object as XML in a very easy way.

All labels (for classes, properties, etc.) have meaningful names.
